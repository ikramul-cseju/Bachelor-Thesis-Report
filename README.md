This is my final year BSc thesis report which I wrote for the completion of my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering

Biofloc aquaculture can be challenging and intricate for farmers to manage, but it can be highly efficient and lucrative when done correctly. This project presents a real-time Internet of Things (IoT)-driven water quality monitoring and classification system for biofloc aquaculture using machine learning. The system aims to provide a reliable and efficient method for monitoring water quality parameters in biofloc aquaculture and to classify the water quality based on machine learning algorithms. It consists of a set of sensors that continuously monitor the water quality parameters such as pH, TDS, temperature, and ammonia concentration, and transmit the data to a cloud server through a wireless network. Machine learning algorithms are then used to classify the water quality based on the collected data. The system's performance was evaluated using a biofloc aquaculture setup, and the results showed that the system was able to accurately monitor and classify the water quality parameters in real-time. This system can be used as a tool for farmers to improve their biofloc aquaculture practices, and can also be extended to other aquaculture systems for efficient water quality monitoring and management.
